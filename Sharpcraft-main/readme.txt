requirememts: 
.net sdk 8.0.x
visual studio 2022

please run extract_assets.cmd after installing the requirements.

do not ask me for help in setting up, i will not help you.

maybe xp/vista support sometime in the future but i would have to compile lwcsgl to like framework 3.5
plus then i would need a custom dll for opengl > 1.2

why am i even doing this bullshit? i have no fucking clue.
i have a terrible headache.
